== RubyComments

A Ruby on Rails demo to simulate a comment/blog website. Database handling done through MySQL, website formatted through HTML, CSS and SASS.

Demo was generated with the reasonably latest version of Ruby. SASS was added for better appearance.

As always, you assume any risk of using this on your website. Please make sure you check the _database.yml_ file in the _config_ folder to confirm the proper host, socket, database, and usename/password values you wish to use (especially if you are going to attempt to put this into production).
